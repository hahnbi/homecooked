## Usage

> Users will create an account to have access to see information on the meals presented by other users. Once logged in, users can see information about the meals, including days of the week that the cooker is available to cook the meal, and what is included in the meal. Once decided on the meal, Home Cooked will connect the two users.

Users can also most meals they would like to cook for others as well. They can go to the post page and fill out a form with all of the information about the meal. The meal will instantly be available for other users to choose on the main list page.
